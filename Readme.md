### Requirements
- [.NET Framework 4.7.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) or later (included in Windows 10 version 1803 and later)

### Arguments
- `--enable-cheat "CHEAT NAME"`
    - Optional, can be passed 0 or more times.
    - Automatically enables the given cheat on trainer startup, instead of you having to manually click the checkbox.
    - `CHEAT NAME` is the name of the cheat as it appears in the trainer UI, such as `No speed limit`. Case-insensitive.
    - Useful if you always want to play a game with a given cheat active, and you want to launch the game with a batch file that both starts the game and starts the trainer with this cheat enabled.
        ```bat
        @echo off
        Dakar2Game.exe
        DakarDesertRallyTrainer.exe --enable-cheat "No speed limit"
        ```

## Dakar Desert Rally

![trainer screenshot](.github/images/dakardesertrally.png)

[ðŸ’¾ Download](https://github.com/Aldaviva/Trainers/releases/latest/download/DakarDesertRallyTrainer.exe)

- No speed limit
    - All speed limit penalties, and red and yellow speed warnings, are removed in all difficulty levels.
    - The gray speed limit warning is still visible in Simulation Mode and areas with speed limits, like villages and passage control.
    - Hilariously, you are *not* limited to 30 km/h in passage control auto-driving zones, unlike in [Dakar 18](#dakar-18). Therefore, you may want to slow down and disable this cheat before entering passage control, in order to avoid missing the exit and getting stuck in auto-drive for the rest of the stage.
