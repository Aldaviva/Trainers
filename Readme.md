## Dakar Desert Rally

- No speed limit
    - All speed limit penalties, and red and yellow warnings, are removed in all difficulty levels.
    - The gray speed limit warning is still visible in Simulation Mode and areas with speed limits, like villages and passage control.
    - Hilariously, you are *not* limited to 30 km/h in passage control auto-driving zones, unlike in [Dakar 18](#dakar-18). Therefore, you may want to slow down and disable this cheat before entering passage control, in order to avoid missing the exit and getting stuck in auto-drive for the rest of the stage.

*Supports Dakar Desert Rally 1.6.0, released on January 20, 2023, which has build number 10366290*
