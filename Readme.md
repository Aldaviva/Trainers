- No speed limit
    - Yellow and red warnings and penalties for exceeding the speed limit are removed in all difficulty levels.
    - The gray speed limit warning is still visible in Simulation Mode, as well as in areas with speed limits like villages and passage control auto-driving zones, so just ignore it.
    - Hilariously, you will experience unavoidable full-throttle acceleration in passage control zones, so be careful if there are vehicles waiting in front of you.
