<a id="requirements"></a>
## Requirements
- [.NET Framework 4.7.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) or later (included in Windows 10 version 1803 and later)

## Arguments
- `--enable-cheat "CHEAT NAME"`
    - Optional, can be passed 0 or more times.
    - Automatically enables the given cheat on trainer startup, instead of you having to manually click the checkbox.
    - `CHEAT NAME` is the name of the cheat as it appears in the trainer UI, such as `No speed limit`. Case-insensitive. Remember to use quotation marks if it contains spaces.
    - Useful if you always want to play a game with a given cheat active, and you want to launch the game with a batch file that both starts the game and starts the trainer with this cheat enabled.
        ```bat
        @echo off
        start Dakar2Game.exe
        start DakarDesertRallyTrainer.exe --enable-cheat "No speed limit" --enable-cheat "No damage"
        ```

### Dakar Desert Rally

![trainer screenshot](.github/images/dakardesertrally.png)

[üíæ Download](https://github.com/Aldaviva/Trainers/releases/latest/download/DakarDesertRallyTrainer.exe)

- No speed limit
    - All speed limit penalties, and red and yellow speed warnings, are removed in all difficulty levels.
    - The gray speed limit warning is still visible in Simulation Mode and areas with speed limits, like villages and passage control, but it's not enforced.
    - The co-driver doesn't scold you for going fast.
    - Hilariously, you are *not* limited to 30 km/h in passage control auto-driving zones, unlike in [Dakar 18](#dakar-18). Therefore, you may want to slow down and disable this cheat before entering passage control, in order to avoid [missing the exit and getting stuck in auto-drive for the rest of the stage](https://twitter.com/Aldaviva/status/1602037249650081793).
- No damage
    - Vehicles don't take damage to the Mechanics, Wheels, or Suspension parts categories during stages.
    - They still take Body damage, including dirt and bent body panels, but these don't affect the vehicle's performance.
    - The co-driver will still exclaim when you would have taken damage.
    - Enable this cheat before starting a stage. If you enable it during a stage, it won't take effect until the next stage.
    - After disabling this cheat, restart the game for it to take effect.
    - This cheat is little unreliable and may not work all the time. If you can't get it to work, try restarting the game while this cheat is still enabled in the trainer.
