<a id="requirements"></a>
## Requirements
- [.NET Framework 4.7.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) or later (included in Windows 10 version 1803 and later)

## Arguments
- `--enable-cheat "CHEAT NAME"`
    - Optional, can be passed 0 or more times.
    - Automatically enables the given cheat on trainer startup, instead of you having to manually click the checkbox.
    - `CHEAT NAME` is the name of the cheat as it appears in the trainer UI, such as `No speed limit`. Case-insensitive.
    - Useful if you always want to play a game with a given cheat active, and you want to launch the game with a batch file that both starts the game and starts the trainer with this cheat enabled.
        ```bat
        @echo off
        start Dakar2Game.exe
        start DakarDesertRallyTrainer.exe --enable-cheat "No speed limit" --enable-cheat "No damage"
        ```

### Dakar Desert Rally

[ðŸ’¾ Download](https://github.com/Aldaviva/Trainers/releases/latest/download/DakarDesertRallyTrainer.exe)

- No speed limit
    - All speed limit penalties, and red and yellow speed warnings, are removed in all difficulty levels.
    - The gray speed limit warning is still visible in Simulation Mode and areas with speed limits, like villages and passage control.
    - Hilariously, you are *not* limited to 30 km/h in passage control auto-driving zones, unlike in [Dakar 18](#dakar-18). Therefore, you may want to slow down and disable this cheat before entering passage control, in order to avoid missing the exit and getting stuck in auto-drive for the rest of the stage.
- No damage
    - Vehicles don't take damage to the Mechanics, Wheels, or Suspension parts categories during stages.
    - They still take Body damage, including dirt and bent body panels, but these don't affect the vehicle's performance.
    - The co-driver will still exclaim when you would have taken damage.
    - Enable this cheat before starting a stage. If you enable it during a stage, it won't take effect until the next stage.
    - After disabling this cheat, restart the game for it to take effect.
